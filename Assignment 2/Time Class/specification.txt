Test Time
Version 2

SPECIFICATION

OVERVIEW

This program reads times as they are input by the user and returns the difference between the two times.


DETAILS

The program begins by prompting the user for a time as follows:

    Enter two times (24-Hour Format):

The program then displays the time in two ways:

    Initial Values: 
    HH:MM (12-Hour Format: HH:MM a.m. or HH:MM p.m.)
    HH:MM (12-Hour Format: HH:MM a.m. or HH:MM p.m.)

The program then calculates the difference between the two times and prints that value:

    The difference between HH:MM and HH:MM is <number of hours> hours.
