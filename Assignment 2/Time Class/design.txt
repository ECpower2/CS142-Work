Test Time
Version 2

DESIGN

NEW IN THIS VERSION: Added alternative functions for initialize, print

  o int main()
    
    Takes user input for two times and prints the difference between said times. See program specifications for details.

    Collaborator: Time


  o Class: Time

    Each Time object represents a time on a 24-hour clock (0:00 to 23:59).

    Operations:

	void initialize()
	    Sets both hours and minutes to 99. This guarantees that a generically initialized time will have invalid values.

	void initialize(const int h, const int m)
	    Sets hours to h; sets minutes to m.

	void read(istream & in)
	    Reads two integers from in, stores them in the specified time as hours and minutes respectively.

	void print(ostream & out) const
	    Prints specified time to out in the format HH:MM. Assumes a 24-Hour Clock.

	void print12(const Time & t, ostream & out) const
	    Prints specified time to out in the format HH:MM a.m. or HH:MM p.m. Assumes a 12-Hour Clock; adjusts 24-Hour Clock times as needed.

	double minus(const Time & t2) const
	    Computes the difference, in hours, between the specified time and t2 by subtracting t2 from the specified time.
