Test Song
Version 1

SPECIFICATION

OVERVIEW

This program reads a song input by the user and compares it to a generically initialized song.


DETAILS

The program begins by asking the user for a song title and artist as follows:

    Enter a song title and artist:
    Title
    Artist

Once it reads the song information, the program repeats what the user entered:

    You entered the song:
    Title
    Artist

The program then prints the song it will be using for comparison:

    Comparing to:
    invalid
    none

Finally, the program compares the songs; it prints True if the song titles and artists are the same, and it prints False otherwise
