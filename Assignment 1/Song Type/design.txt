  o Song

    Each Song object holds a title and artist value. Both values are stored as strings.

    Operations:

	void initialize(Song & s)
	    Sets s.title to "invalid"; sets s.artist to "none".

	void initialize(Song & s, const string title, const string artist)
	    Sets s.title to title; sets s.artist to artist.

	void print(const Song & s, ostream & out)
	    Prints s to out in the format:
		Title
		Artist

	void read(Song & s, istream & in)
	    Reads two strings from in, stores them as s.title and s.artist respectively.

	bool is_equal(Song & s1, Song & s2)
	    Compares the titles and artists of s1 and s2. If both the titles and artists are equal, returns true. Otherwise, returns false.
