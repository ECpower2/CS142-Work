Test Song
Version 1.3

SPECIFICATION

OVERVIEW

This program runs through the methods and functions for the Song class and checks that they function correctly.


DETAILS

The program begins by constructing two generic songs ("Emergency", "Icona Pop" and "Down the Road", "c2c"):
Once it has created these songs, the program tests the get and set methods by setting song1 to "Lightning Bolt", "Jake Bugg" and printing the result:

    Testing Get and Set Methods
    New Title: Lightning Bolt
    New Artist: Jake Bugg

The program then tests the input and output methods by asking the user to enter a song title and artist:

    Testing Input and Output Methods:
    Please enter a song title and artist:

The program reads the new values and stores them as song2; it then prints song2 to confirm the user's changes.

Finally, the program compares the songs using the '==' operator

    Testing Compare Method:
    Comparing the following songs:
    <song1 title>
    <song1 artist>

    <song2 title>
    <song2 artist>

If the compare function returns true, the program prints:

    "Songs are equal."

Otherwise, the program prints:

    "Songs are not equal."


If the song titles and artists are not the same, it prints:

    These songs are not the same song
