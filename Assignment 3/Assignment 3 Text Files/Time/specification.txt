Test Time
Version 2

SPECIFICATION

OVERVIEW

This program runs through the methods and functions for the Time class and checks that they function correctly.

DETAILS

The program begins initializing two times. The first is initialized to midnight and the second is initialized generically (99:99).

The program first tests the "<<" operator, printing the first time as follows:

    Stored Time:
    0:00

The program then tests the ">>" operator by prompting the user to enter a time for the generically initialized time:

    Please enter a new time:
    HH:MM

The program reads this time and stores it to t2, then continues on to test the subtraction operator:

    Testing Subtraction Operator:
    Time 1: 0:00
    Time 2: HH:MM
    The difference between these two times is n hours.

Lastly, the program tests the '=' operator by setting t1 to 12 and printing the result:

    The time is now 12:00
